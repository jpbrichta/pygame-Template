# pygame-Template
This is a basic template for pygame projects.

Before you can use this file, you will need to install pygame on your machine. Don't worry--this should be pretty easy.

On WINDOWS machines

1. Open Git BASH.
2. Type the following commands (the > is the prompt)

> py -m pip install -U pygame --user
> py -m pygame.examples.aliens

3. The first command will install pygame. The second will launch an alien shooter game (so you know if pygame is working).
4. If that doesn't work, call me over.

On MAC machines

1. Open a Terminal
2. Type the following commands (the > is the prompt)

> python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
> python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens

3. The first command will install pygame. The second will launch an alien shooter game (so you know if pygame is working).
4. If that doesn't work, call me over.
